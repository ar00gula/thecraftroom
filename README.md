Repository for my Phase 3 Rails Project


# The Craft Room

The Craft Room is an online resource for personal organziation and prioritizing of crafts and craft supplies. Born out of my inability to remember the contents of generally-labeled boxes, The Craft Room is a place where you can externalize your knowledge of what you have on hand and leave more room in your mind for planning your projects.

## Installation/Usage

In your terminal, navigate to repository after downloading, then execute:

    $ bundle install

In your terminal, execute: 
    $ rails s

Then, in your browser, navigate to localhost:3000/ .

## Development

This site is currently under development. There is a great deal more that it wishes to be able to do, including:
    - Differentiate supplies and tools
    - Add a system for counting how many of an item is in stock
    - Differentiate, search, and organize by color
    - Differentiate, search, and organize by brand
    - Bulk uploading of supplies
    - A greater library of seed data
However, at the moment, my concentration is on creating a simple but pleasurable user experience that will inspire the user to return.
